Summary

...or "omelette" if you prefer.
These files are for plotting an omelet recipe on eggs using an Eggbot. Use the file omelet.svg or omelet-1-serving.svg if you park the "pointy" end of your eggs at the egg motor cup. Use omelet-flipped.svg or omelet-1-serving-flipped.svg if, like me, you park the fat end of your eggs at the egg motor's egg cup. (Less slippage when you do that, eh?)
Note that the text is sized such that you don't need a nano sized pen tip: I used a Sharpie Ultra Fine for the pictured egg.
So how many servings for omelet.svg and omelet-flipped.svg? Those two files have a "2 serving" recipe which calls for two eggs. If you desire a more self-contained recipe, then go with the "1 serving" variants. And, if you need nutrition info, well just see http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7232 and then mentally add in the 2 or 1 Tbsp of cream and 3/4 or 1/2 Tbsp of butter. (Butter is about 100 calories per Tbsp and there's about 50 calories per Tbsp for heavy cream [the yummy stuff].)
Bon appetit!

Instructions

The drawing is 800 x 3200 pixels and consists of two layers:
1 - test: this is a test layer. Plot it with or without a pen to check the framing of your egg. It has two tiny, horizontal strokes at y=0 and y=800.
2 - text: this is the layer with the recipe. Plot it after you have things centered to your liking.
Use the "Layers" tab of the Eggbot Control extension to plot each layer individually.
NOTE BENE: These files wrap the text around and around the egg by using the Eggbot Control's "Egg (x) axis wraps around" option. Be sure to set that option on the "Options" tab of the Eggbot Control extension and then click the "Apply" button.
And remember, you can't make omelets without breaking eggs.
