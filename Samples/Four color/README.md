Four color, geometric Eggbot plot

Summary

This is a four color geometric pattern for plotting on eggs with the Eggbot. The SVG drawing has a height of 800 pixels and has an aspect ratio appropriate for plotting on eggs. To adjust for plotting on spheres, rescale the vertical size to a height of 1200 pixels. Then remove rows so as to obtain the desired vertical height (e.g., 1000 pixels).
Plotting this drawing successfully requires a high degree of plotting accuracy (e.g., to prevent unwanted registration problems). So, be sure to carefully load your egg with the correct tension.
The included Python file is the Python code to generate the basic drawing with dimensions 1200 x 3200. In Inkscape, I then rescaled the vertical dimension by 63.333% so as to get an aspect ratio suitable for drawing on eggs. (66.666% might seem more apropos, but I wanted to be a tad shorter than 800 pixels and hence 63.3333%)

Instructions

To aid in framing the drawing on your egg, layer "1 - test" has two short horizontal lines at y=800 and y=0.
The four remaining layers each contain a single color: 2 - yellow, 3 - orange, 4 - turquoise, and 5 - magenta.
